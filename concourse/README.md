### Install Process and first pipeline
[Quick Start](https://concourse-ci.org/quick-start.html)

* Make sure Docker is up to date and you have the docker-compose plugin installed

* Get the docker-compose file and run it:
```bash
curl -O https://concourse-ci.org/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```

You should now be able to access Concourse on: http://localhost:8080

* Get and install fly-cli:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/cli?arch=amd64&platform=linux' -o fly && chmod +x ./fly && sudo mv ./fly /usr/local/bin/
```

* Log fly-cli into the concourse instance running locally:

```bash
fly -t tutorial login -c http://localhost:8080 -u test -p test
logging in to team 'main'
```

* Use hello-world.yml and run the following:

```bash
fly -t tutorial set-pipeline -p hello-world -c hello-world.yml
fly -t tutorial unpause-pipeline -p hello-world
fly -t tutorial trigger-job --job hello-world/hello-world-job --watch
```

You can see the pipeline here:

http://localhost:8080/teams/main/pipelines/hello-world/jobs/hello-world-job


### Running 'make init' on bucket-dir

Have a look at the bucket-dir.yml file.
Needed to add the bucket-dir repo as a resource.
Resources are added as directories to the container and can be passed between jobs 

###  Notes

* Jenkins pipeline = concourse job (Apparently, not too sure though!)
* Pipeline is made up of an unordered list of jobs
* Job comprised of ordered steps.
    * Each step runs in itâ€™s own container on a worker node.
    * Nodes can be linux, darwin or windows.
    * Containers only linux.
* You can control access to pipelines via putting them in seperate [teams](https://concourse-ci.org/auth.html). This could be used to filter pipelines so that users only see what they need to see.
